## About Me
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Collin Riddle and I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in Data Analytics at Furman University. I'm a driven student with a passion for academics and anything Computer Science related, whether that be in the classroom or with Furman's coding competition team. I am currently focusing my academics towards Cybersecurity as I have developed a passion for problem solving and investigating potential vunerabilities in Computer systems. I have strong experience in several programming languages and other necessary applications which allows me to communicate and work efficiently. I'm constantly looking for more opportunities to be involved on my campus, find leadership opportunities, and grow as a student.

#### Technical Skills: Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Linux, WSL, GitHub, Microsoft Office Suite.

## Projects
Below is where the fun stuff begins. As of now, I have a list of two group projects which I go into greater detail than that of what is on my resume. You can currently find a copy of the Geometry Fact Computer on my GitHub profile, check it out!

### Geometry Fact Computer
- This was a Data Structures and Algorithms class project centered around the use object-oriented programming and Java's main data structures (maps, trees, linked lists, etc.) We utilized GitHub freqently for pushing and pulling our changes in an effective manner.
- More on the technical side, majority of this project was focused on creating a parser that could parse a JSON-formatted file and identify points, segments, angles, and triangles. With as many classes and working pieces as this project took, I learned how to apply interfaces, use inheritance, use generic types, and implement a fair amount of frameworks (hash maps and sets, array lists, JSON objects, etc.) 
- While spending a great deal of time refining technical skills, I also learned how to effectively communicate struggles, capitalize on successes, and generally turn the group into one cohesive unit throughout the semester.

### Restaurant Website
- This next is an active project, in which myself and a group of three others are working to create a fully functioning website. We are creating a method of searching for restaurants from in and around Greenville, South Carolina through food type, location, ratings, and so on.
- As of right now, we have utilized a fair bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic skeleton for the Website's frontend. We utilize AJAX to allow for better transporting of data from our backend (Flask) to the frotend. We have used GET and POST requests, Flask templates (using Jinja syntax), and are currently in the process of implementing Nginx and Gunicorn for better hosting of the website.
